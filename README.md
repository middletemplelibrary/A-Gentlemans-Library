## 1. Introduction: A Gentleman’s Library
It was common for a learned gentleman to amass a private library consisting of thousands of volumes in the 16th and 17th centuries. Works on theology would have a dominant presence in these personal collections, but texts on history, literature, classics and the natural world would also be prevalent. Anyone engaging in society would accumulate material not only reflecting their professional life, but also the contemporary issues and discussions of the time. Although women were not excluded from education, men were more likely employed in professional fields, such as law, medicine and theology, which required access to books.  This exhibition displays some of Middle Temple Library’s rare books, including those donated from such private collections, visualising what a gentleman’s bookshelf looked like in these earlier centuries.

## 2. Middle Temple Library: Beginnings
While the Inn had a small collection prior to 1540, it was the bequest of Robert Ashley’s collection of circa 5000 books in 1642 which led to the library’s re-founding and expansion. Ashley was admitted to Middle Temple in 1588 and called to the bar in 1595. His collection highlights his interest in a variety of different subject areas including travel, science, medicine, and classical literature. A number of items from his collection are featured in this exhibition, many which feature his handwritten notes. 
<br><br>
Robert Ashley’s legacy is ever present at Middle Temple. The building that the library is currently housed in, is named after him and his full-length portrait which dates to circa 1656 hangs at the back of the Library, watching over the building which houses his collection.
<br><br>
If you would like to read more about Robert Ashley’s life, Middle Temple Library’s Dr Renae Satterley has co-written a fascinating article which translates and examines Robert Ashley’s autobiography, Vita.

## 3. Middle Temple Library: Early Catalogues
Middle Temple Library’s first catalogue was produced in 1655. While this original catalogue no longer exists, a later catalogue compiled in c.1683 can be found in the Inn’s Archive. In 1700 the first printed catalogue was compiled by Sir Bartholomew Shower, who was the Inn’s Treasurer at the time. The 1734 catalogue shown below was the first to arrange the collection by author and title.

## 4. The Ancient World
The rise of the humanist movement in the Renaissance period led to a revived interest in the classical world. Humanists believed that the study of the ancient world was integral to a well-rounded education. The teachings of fifteenth century Italian humanist schools were based on the works of Classical authors such as Cicero, Plato and Virgil and also incorporated the study of ancient art, as well as Latin and philology. In the sixteenth century the Humanist educational curriculum spread throughout Europe and became the model for the schooling of European elites.
<br><br>
From the late sixteenth until the nineteenth century young wealthy European elites would also often embark on a Grand Tour which entailed a lengthy excursion to Europe’s ancient sites. The tour which could last for anything from a few months to a number of years would often include visits to locations such as Rome, Florence, Naples, Athens and Sicily. While the aim of the tour was to take in ancient sites and art as well as languages and literature, these trips also enabled elite young men to enter fashionable and aristocratic European society.

## 5. Virgil, <cite>The works of Virgil: Containing his Pastorals, Georgics, and Aeneis (1697)</cite>, translated by John Dryden
<i>“Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town”</i>
<br><br>
(Virgil, <cite>Aeneid</cite> 1.1-5).
<br><br>
Translated by John Dryden
<br><br>
This collection of Virgil’s works was printed at “at the Fudges-Head in Fleet Street, near the Inner-Temple-Gate” in 1697. It was translated by the English poet and playwright, John Dryden. 
<br><br>
Virgil was born in the village of Andes, in northern Italy, in 44 BC. The <cite>Aeneid</cite>, which was written to praise Augustus, the first emperor of Rome is a Roman imitation of the Greek Homeric poems, the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. The poem was never finished as Virgil died in 19 BC while travelling back from Athens with Augustus. Virgil had left instructions that the poem be burned, however Augustus overruled his wishes and the poem was saved.
<br><br>
Virgil's works have greatly influenced Western literature. Most notably the Divine Comedy of Dante, in which Virgil appears as the Dante’s guide through Hell and Purgatory.

## 6. Apuleius, <cite>Les metamorphoses ou l'asne dor</cite> (1623), translated by Chez Samuel Thibous From the collection of Robert Ashley (1565-1641)
This French translation of Roman writer and philosopher, Apuleius’ <cite>The Metamorphoses</cite> or <cite>The Golden Ass</cite> was published in Paris in 1623. The title <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> comes from an eleventh century manuscript however, Augustine tells us that Apuleius himself used the title <cite>Asinus Aureus</cite> (CD 18.18). The tale which is believed to have been inspired by a now lost Greek story, is the only ancient Roman novel which survives in its entirety. Within the fable its hero Lucius’ obsession with sex and magic leads to him being transformed into an ass by the witch, Pamphile. After surviving a number of trials and ordeals he is finally transformed back into his human form by the goddess Isis.
<br><br>
The novel inspired a number of works by sixteenth and seventeenth century writers including Spencer’s <cite>The Faerie Queen</cite>, Marlowe’s <cite>Hero and Leander</cite>, Sidney’s <cite>Arcadia</cite>, Milton’s <cite>Paradise Regained</cite>, and most famously, Shakespeare’s <cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>.

## 7. A Fable Within a Fable: <cite>Cupid and Psyche</cite> in Apuleius’ <cite>The Golden Ass</cite>
By the end of Book 3 the story’s protagonist Lucius has been magically transformed into a Donkey. Following a series of unfortunate events, he finds himself imprisoned in a Bandits’ hideout alongside a young woman who has been taken hostage by the robbers.  The young woman after waking from a terrifying dream is distracted from her night terrors by an ‘old wife’s tale’ told to her by an ‘old hag’ who lives with the bandits. The tale which takes up three central chapters of Apuleius’ fable is that of Cupid and Psyche. 
<br><br>
The fable’s themes of a young girl with two jealous sisters who is courted by an enchanted suiter, rumoured to be a monster as well as the impossible trials which are imposed upon her by have parallels in the folk tales of many cultures. 
<br><br>
<i>“Then Psyche, though enfeebled in both body and mind, gained the strength lent her by fate’s harsh decree. She uncovered the lamp, seized the razer, and showed a boldness that belied her sex. But as soon as the lamp was brought near, and the secrets of the couch were revealed, she beheld of all beasts the gentlest and sweetest, Cupid himself, a handsome god lying in a handsome posture (Apuleius, The Golden Ass 5.22).”</i>
<br><br>

## 8. Apuleius (mid-120 AD -?)
Apuleius was born in the mid-120s AD in Madauros, an ancient Roman city in Numidia (modern day Algeria). His father was a <i>duumvir</i>, one of the Roman colony’s two chief magistrates. Apuleius’ education took him to both Carthage where he studied philosophy and to Greece where he gained a wide knowledge of Greek literature and culture. At the age of thirty Apuleius visited Egypt where he fell ill on his way to Alexandria. He was encouraged by Pontius, an acquaintance he made while studying in Athens, to stay in his family home in Oea (modern day Tripoli). Whilst staying with the family Apuleius began a relationship with Pontius’ mother Pudentilla, claiming he loved the wealthy widow for her “sterling qualities”. However, Pudentilla’s father, Herennius Rufus objected to the match and persuaded Sicinius Aemilianus, the brother of her first husband to indict Apuleius on a charge of magic which was punishable by death. The trial was held before proconsul, Claudius Maximus in 158-9 AD. Apuleius defended himself in the trial with a speech, which has survived and is commonly known as the <i>Apologia</i>. He successfully secured his acquittal.
<br><br>
<i>“I will now deal with the actual charge of magic. You spared no violence in fanning the flame of hatred against me. But you have disappointed all men's expectations by your old wives' fables, and the fire kindled by your accusations has burned itself away. I ask you, Maximus, have you ever seen fire spring up among the stubble, crackling sharply, blazing wide and spreading fast, but soon exhausting its flimsy fuel, dying fast away, leaving not a wrack behind? So they have kindled their accusation with abuse and fanned it with words, but it lacks the fuel of facts and, your verdict once given, is destined to leave not a wrack of calumny behind. The whole of Aemilianus' calumnious accusation was centred in the charge of magic. I should therefore like to ask his most learned advocates how, precisely, they would define a magician?”</i> (Apuleius, <cite>Apologia</cite> 25)
<br><br>
Translated by H. E. Butler
<br><br>
Following the trial Apuleius returned to Numidia and took up residence in Carthage. He gained fame far and wide as a writer, philosopher and lecturer.

## 9. Johannes Rosinus (1551-1626), <cite>Antiquitatum Romanarum Corpus Absolutissum</cite>, 1620 From the collection of Robert Ashley (1565-1641)
The first edition of the <cite>Antiquitatum Romanarum Corpus Absolutissum</cite> was published in 1583. The work is an illustrated encyclopaedia of Roman antiquity by the German author, Johannes Rosinus. Rosinus studied at Jena, before becoming the sub-rector of a school at Regensburg. In later years he became the minister of a Lutheran church in Naumburg, Saxony. 
<br><br>
Later editions such as this were expanded and amended by the Scottish Catholic scholar and historian, Thomas Dempster (1579-1625). The 1613 edition was dedicated to King James I which won Dempster an invitation to the English court.

## 10 Heinrich Ernst and Paganino Gaudenzio, <cite>Ad antiquitates Etruscas quas Volaterrae nuper dederunt observationes, in quibus disquisitionis astronomicae de etruscarum antiquitatum fragmentis auctor quoque notatur</cite>, 1639 From the collection of Robert Ashley (1565-1641)
<cite>Ad antiquitates Etruscas</cite> is a response to Curzio Inghirami’s <cite>Ethruscarum Antiquitatum Fragmenta</cite> which was published in Florence in 1636. This work on the Etruscan history of Volterra was based on the contents of a number of paper scrolls which had been discovered by Inghirami near his family home, south of the Etruscan city of Volterra. The Latin text on the scrolls suggested they had been written in the first century B.C. by an Etruscan man named Prospero of Fiesole. 
<br><br>
However, on publication, Paganino Gaudenzio who was the University of Pisa’s professor of humane letters questioned the authenticity of Inghirami’s works. His <cite>De Charta: Exercitatio</cite> (1636) which traced the history of the Latin word <i>charta</i> (writing material) had established that paper was not invented until the medieval period. 
<br><br>
<cite>Ad antiquitates Etruscas</cite> written alongside Danish scholar, Heinrich Ernst, also questions the contents of the scrolls, particularly the parts dedicated to Astronomy.
<br><br>
<i>“Who, unless they have their brain in their feet, does not see that all of the things he [Curzio] has collected are ridiculous, made up, twisted? On page 4 of the Fragments he refers to three stars, Caris, Mor, and Turg: What, I ask, are these stars?”</i>
<br><br>
Translated by Ingrid D. Rowland
<br><br>
Gaudenzio theory that the scrolls were fakes was proved correct in 1700, (45 years after Curzio’s death) when a Tuscan artist, noticed that the paper which the texts were written on bore the watermark of the state paper factory in Colle di Val d’Elsa.
